## Getting started: 10 seconds to Ruban

Here is the example:
    sample_path is captcha data.

```python
from ruban.applications import InkFountain

ink_fountain = InkFountain(sample_path=r'InkFountainData', lr=0.001)
```

train as easy as `.train()`:

```python
ink_fountain.train()
```

Once your model trained, use it as easy as `.test()`:

```python
ink_fountain.test()
```
